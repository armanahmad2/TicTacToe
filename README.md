# TicTacToe
Play TicTacToe

## Directly run

Downlaod zip and run *TicTacToe.exe*.

## Build and run

To build and run the sample, change to the *TicTacToe-master/TicTacToe* directory and execute the following command:

```console
dotnet run
```

`dotnet run` builds the sample and runs the output executable. It implicitly runs `dotnet restore` ([see note](#dotnet-restore-note)) to restore the dependencies of the sample. If you're using .NET Core 1.0 or .NET Core 1.1 instead of .NET Core 2.0 or a later version, you have to run `dotnet restore` yourself.
